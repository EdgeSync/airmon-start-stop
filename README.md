# Airmon-start-stop

When doing wireless pentesting it can be quite tedious to continually put up and down your adapter.

These small scripts will pass command line arguments to do the steps for you.


## Files

Two files included - **start-pwnwifi** and **stop-pwnwifi**

### If running as root:
copy files to **/usr/local/bin** and **chmod +x** the file

### If running as regular user:
You need to have sudo access
add sudo to start of each command
copy files to **/usr/local/bin** and **chmod +x** the file

These are in no way complex, just time savers.
